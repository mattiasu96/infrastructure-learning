# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the "main" branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
#     - https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
#
# 3. Reference the GitHub secret in step using the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` GitHub Action.
#   Example:
#     - name: Setup Terraform
#       uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
#       with:
#         cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}

  terraform:
    name: 'Terraform'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production

    # Use the Bash shell regardless whether the GitHub Actions runner is ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, or windows-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        shell: bash

    steps:
    # Checkout the repository to the GitHub Actions runner
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Install the latest version of Terraform CLI and configure the Terraform CLI configuration file with a Terraform Cloud user API token
    - name: Setup Terraform
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
      with:
        cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}

    # Initialize a new or existing Terraform working directory by creating initial files, loading any remote state, downloading modules, etc.
    - name: Terraform Init
      run: terraform init

    # Checks that all Terraform configuration files adhere to a canonical format
    - name: Terraform Format
      run: terraform fmt -check

    # Generates an execution plan for Terraform
    - name: Terraform Plan
      run: terraform plan -input=false

      # On push to "main", build or change infrastructure according to Terraform configuration files
      # Note: It is recommended to set up a required "strict" status check in your repository for "Terraform Cloud". See the documentation on "strict" required status checks for more information: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/types-of-required-status-checks
    - name: Terraform Apply
      # if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/"main"' && github.event_name == 'push'
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve


# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "main" branch.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
#    Replace the value of the `ECR_REPOSITORY` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.
#    Replace the value of the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.
#
# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_SERVICE` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_CLUSTER` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster.
#
# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` environment variable in the workflow below with the path to the JSON file.
#    Replace the value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable in the workflow below with the name of the container
#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
#
# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.
